# Challenge 1 HTML
## **Pre-course exercise** for FAC 
substitution of the `<div>` with a more appropriate semantic HTML 

| I already knew  | what I've learned | 
|-----------------|-------------------|
|meta             | label
|title            | blockquote
|header           | cite
|h1-h6            |
|image alt        |
|p                |
|section          |
|form input button|
|footer           |

### The tag I used that wasn't in the solution, but I thought it \*might worked\* was: ###
``` 
<pre>
``` 
`<pre>` element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file.

<!-- Task List -->
* [x] Bonus 
    * find and fix few missing things that arenâ€™t necessarily related to semantics :relaxed:
